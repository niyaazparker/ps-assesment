## Things i would change about the https://www.onlineskinshop.co.za/ website

```
* Because the first thing i noticed when seeing this webpage was inconsitant spacing, i woudl would on that first as it would make significat change once spacing amongs elements are more consistent.
* I would use more svg and icon fonts and less images for items that can be icon, that would reduce page load time and also the amount of http request.
* I would do complete redesign on how the website functions on mobile as i have seen the experience isnt that great and nowadays people are more inclined to get a first impression of your website on mobile as it is the first and most accessible point.
